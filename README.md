# dagger-sample-test
Set of tests that reveal how different dagger dependencies are resolved

# How to use
Each package contains the Dagger file(s) with both module and component classes and the Demo file wich contains the class that requires injection.
In the test folder there is one test file per example that executes the injection in the different ways and prints the summary on injected object to show how Dagger works for given configuration.
